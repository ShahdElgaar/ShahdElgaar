I am inetrested in data analysis and transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I enjoy working with real-world datasets,
focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and building analytical models to support data-driven decision-making.

I have experience using Jupyter notebook, Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
My projects emphasize clear structure, reproducibility, and interpretability, combining technical implementation with analytical reasoning.

I am continuously developing my skills in data analysis and machine learning, and I enjoy learning how to apply these tools to practical problems across different domains.
